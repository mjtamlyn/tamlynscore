H2H changes
===========
Drawing up the map of the field
H2H arrow scores
Better support for sponsors/sponsor images
API for an app
Redesign!


Admin
=====
Transfer script (transfer an individual competition)
Access to competition restricted by user - across all views
Ability to edit an entry
Remove "B" teams added for BUTC, and tidy up short names of clubs
Remove any competitions I don't have data for..
Remove Club.abbreviation - I don't think it's used anywhere


Code tidyness
=============
PEP8
Tests!
Think about created/modified
Collapse TargetAllocation and Score onto SessionEntry - remove lots of rows, lots of joins and general complexity
Move hosted_by to competition not tournament (also use it!)
Work backwards through competitions making sure each one has results configured correctly, and all features are supported, then remove old results code
Ability to set certain pages as publicly accessible
Easy ways to get to mobile website
Django 1.5 and create custom User model
Move to Braces instead of class_view_decorator
Py3??
Standardise url names on '-' not '_'


Long term plan
==============
Competition management page
    - edit config options for competitions
    - create sessions and session rounds, olympic rounds etc.
Accept entries from the front end (publicly)
    - sign up
    - payment??
    - by club only to start with - means we need club admins who can edit clubs



New leaderboard/results code
============================

Things we need to be able to do:

Pick different types of results
Each type of results should have a leaderboard page
Can have leaderboard pages there which aren't included in the results
Can get any individual leaderboard page as a pdf
Results view vs leaderboard view
Each leaderboard page should automatically get a 'big screen' version

Leaderboard pages can have subpages for each category/type, and for each output format (standard/big screen/winners html/winners pdf/full pdf/mobile html)
Winners/summary output format (visible and pdf) (top 5 only in each category - display the number of entries)

Types of results
----------------
By session
Combined by round across sessions (respects exclude_later_shoots)
Double round
Teams

Later:
Progress (i.e. across sessions "the state after 3 dozen")
National Series style combination results
Aggregate results (sum the scores)

Configuration options
---------------------

exclude_later_shoots
has_juniors
juniors_in_senior_teams
juniors_in_senior_individual
has_novices
novices_in_experienced_teams
novices_in_experienced_individual
team_size
has_novice_teams
novice_team_size

Later:
Restrictions on make up of team (e.g. must include one lady or junior)
