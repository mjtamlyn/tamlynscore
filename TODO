New leaderboard/results code
============================

Things we need to be able to do:

Pick different types of results
Each type of results should have a leaderboard page
Can have leaderboard pages there which aren't included in the results
Can get any individual leaderboard page as a pdf
Results view vs leaderboard view
Each leaderboard page should automatically get a 'big screen' version

Leaderboard pages can have subpages for each category/type, and for each output format (standard/big screen/winners html/winners pdf/full pdf/mobile html)
Winners/summary output format (visible and pdf) (top 5 only in each category - display the number of entries)

Types of results
----------------
By session
Combined by round across sessions (respects exclude_later_shoots)
Double round
Teams

Later:
Progress (i.e. across sessions "the state after 3 dozen")
National Series style combination results
Aggregate results (sum the scores)

Configuration options
---------------------

exclude_later_shoots
has_juniors
juniors_in_senior_teams
juniors_in_senior_individual
has_novices
novices_in_experienced_teams
novices_in_experienced_individual
team_size
has_novice_teams
novice_team_size

Later:
Restrictions on make up of team (e.g. must include one lady or junior)
